								<p>The renowned publishing house, Penguin Random House, faced a fall in profit of 12% during the first half of 2025.</p>
								<p><h2>What is the new challenge?</h2></p>
								<p>While Penguin Random House still maintains its status as one of the Big Five publishing houses, after the pandemic its position in the market has suffered from periods of important declines in profit and growth. Most recently, during the first half of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;"> Publishers Weekly</a>, PHR profit dropped 12%. The article explained that macroeconomic factors like rising production costs, the political uncertainty, and the restrictive tariff imposed by the Trump administration played a significant role in this fall. The parent company Bertelsmann's spokesman explained that despite the revenue rising to €2.3 billion, operating EBITDA fell 12%, to €255 million ($297.5 million), primarily due <i>“to lower revenues and growth-related expenses in the core U.S. business.”</i></p>
								<p>Interestingly, this and <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 other</a> articles by Publishers Weekly emphasized that under the direction of Nihar Malaviya, PHR has been deeply concerned about <i>fighting for the right to read</i> due to all the unprecedented book bans against diversity and non-normative authors in the U.S. Indeed, the book bans across the country has threatened with undermining the career of minority or marginalized authors and harming the awareness of so many topics that composes the everyday life, fantasies and preocupation of marginalized people. This includes books that talk about police's racial biases, trans childhood, queer love, and much more. All of these, naturally, at the same time harms the sales prospect by the houses that published the books involved. </p>
								<p><h2>What did Penguin Random House?</h2></p>
								<p>Since the growth of social media, users now have more avenues for changing things that matter to them as consumers, being able to deeply affect the market with their voice. TikTok has become the most influential social media platform in the literary industry since 2020 thanks to its subcommunity named #BookTok. According to the data summarized by  <a href="https://wordsrated.com/booktok-statistics/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
   Words Rated</a>, titles published in 2018 saw an increase in their sales of 812% from June 2019 to June 2022. Furthermore, it was found that 48% of TikTok users read more books than before the use of BookTok. For its part, <a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BookTok-for-WEBSITE.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Publishers Associated</a> found that around 38 percent of young people as of 2022 turned to BookTok for recommendations ahead of family and friends. Finally, in a  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiktok/2025/04/21/the-power-of-booktok-why-tiktoks-book-community-is-driving-a-new-era-in-publishing/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Forbes</a> article backed up by TikTok Internal Data from 2025, it was listed that "As of 2025, #BookTok has accumulated 370 billion views, with over 52 million creations jumping on board—skyrocketing bestsellers, reviving backlist titles, and informing reading habits worldwide."</p>
								<p>Now, while the PRH did address these bans in a few TikTok shorts, offering as contest rewards 30 banned books and a carousel with quotes from Percival Everett encouraging the audience to exercise their right to read, it's noteworthy that PRH could have been more proactive with its marketing in certain areas.</p>

								<h3>Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” Unburnable Copy Stunt</h3>

    <div style="flex: 2;">
        <p>On October 6, 2025, a user named reynaaaa.ts uploaded a camera recording of the promotional video for Margaret Atwood's <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> 'Unburnable' edition. While the original stunt was released in 2022, this UGC reached over 90K likes, proving sustained interest.</p>
        <p>It isn't surprising how this video attracted considerable attention. After all, the cinematic recording is of very high quality, using high light contrast to focus the attention on both the book cover and Margaret Atwood's face. Importantly, this is a special edition of a critically acclaimed book that had already transcended the domain of literary club conversation to become a well-known metaphor, symbol, or warning for social issues like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-44965210" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">abortion rights</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This post represented a high level of engagement; however, there wasn't any clear path toward conversion harnessed by PRH.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <li>The marketing team of Penguin Random House could have created a path toward engagement and conversion by adding a comment (CTA) asking the users to tag a library that required a copy of the 'Unburnable' The Handmaid's Tale edition.</li>
            <li>Penguin Random House could have created a path toward greater awareness and engagement by answering a comment asking for an 'Unburnable' edition of Fahrenheit 451.</li>
            <li>A path toward greater conversion could have been created by adding a CTA telling the users to look for a book copy on their official digital shop.</li>

<h3>Simon & Schuster Comparison: Robin Wall Kimmerer's Captivating Speech</h3>

        <p>On October 5, 2025, Penguin Random House <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@penguinrandomhouse/photo/7557779400587070750?lang=es-419" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 uploaded</a> to TikTok a carousel with quotes by different personalities from the publishing house and renowned authors that addressed the topic of book bans as a tribute for Banned Books Week. The carousel included quotes by Percival Everett, Ibram X. Kendi, and Nikole Hannah-Jones, among others. This post gathered over 14K views, 1569 likes, and around 41 shares. </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
		<li><strong>Observation:</strong> This post, aside from not achieving much engagement for a page with over 100K followers (likes corresponded to around 0.01% of the total follower count), didn't include any clear CTA or conversion path.</li>
         </ul>
		<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@penguinrandomhouse/video/7558118852878503199?lang=es-419" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 Another</a> post for the Banned Books Week was uploaded on October 6. In this post, PRH focused on promoting a contest in which the winner would be awarded 30 banned books. This post gathered a bit over 2300 views, 182 likes, and 15 comments.</p>
		<ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
		<li><strong>Observation:</strong> While the post included a strong CTA consisting of tagging 2 friends and following a few rules indicated in a link added to the description. The post aimed to increase engagement; however, the outcome wasn't as positive, considering that only 15 comments were gathered.</li>
	      </ul>
		<p><strong>How did Simon & Schuster perform instead?</strong></p>
		<p>A good example for comparison for a more engaging post on TikTok during Banned Books Week is the one given by Penguin Random House's rival, Simon & Schuster. On October 6, 2025, Simon & Schuster uploaded a video in which Robin Wall Kimmerer, author of the books <i>The Serviceberry</i> and <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i>, gave an emotive message addressing the topic of reading as a human right. This post amassed almost 150K views, over 41K likes, 164 comments, and 470 shares.</p>
		<p><strong>Why did this post achieve higher performance on social media KPIs (reach and engagement)?</strong></p>
		<p>Simon & Schuster did some things notoriously better. In the first place, the post was a video, and while there is increasing <a href="https://www.ramd.am/blog/why-are-tiktok-carousels-so-popular-and-how-can-brands-use-them" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 evidence</a> evidence that carousels are outperforming videos in most metrics on TikTok, carousels work better when aesthetic images are used or some casual storytelling by slide is told. In contrast, one of the posts from Penguin Random House consists of a carousel of isolated quotes. But there is more: the Simon & Schuster post doesn't only include a video with a person talking, but also the person's face is at the center of the video. Because people are primed to focus on faces and facial expressions, this was a good choice for the recording. In contrast, the Penguin Random House post with a person talking didn't center nor focus on the person in the same fashion.</p>
		<p>Secondly, the thumbnail used is rather thought-provoking and invites the audience to stop the scrolling to think deeply about sensitive matters, since it contains the question <i>"Is reading a human right?"</i> as the sole text from the video.  This question is a direct, short invitation to think, so it would have an immediate impact. Furthermore, the person talking is Robin Wall Kimmerer, an award-winning author known for provocative ideas like rethinking our economy in favor of a gift economy and our relationship with the Earth, who is regarded as an indigenous scientist. Hence, the person at the forefront of the video has authorial credibility while addressing human rights and social justice issues and would be a familiar face for the people that share the same preoccupations.</p>
		<p>Moreover, Robin Wall Kimmerer isn't a guest; she published <i>The Serviceberry</i> under the Scribner imprint within Simon & Schuster, which is dedicated to award-winning authors. In this way, Simon & Schuster isn't just giving a platform for hearing the voices of provocative and politically informed people but shows the authenticity of its commitment by including voices that have published under their house. At the same time, this video serves to subtly promote the book published by the author under its house.</p>
		<p>Simon & Schuster also recognized the importance of connecting with the audience and using storytelling that focuses on human experience. In the video, Kimmerer narrated one anecdote from when she was a fifth-grader and brought home a book from the school library that resulted in the librarian calling her parents to tell them that the book she took was too "old" for her (probably meaning that it was too mature for her age), and how her parents stood up for her. This personal story helps the viewer feel closer to the author and realize how the things discussed have implications in real life.</p>
		<p>Finally, an apparently small detail in the video description that could have helped the post reach more viewers—the hashtags used. As was commented before, #BookTok is a powerful subcommunity that can easily tilt the odds in the publishing industry, and neither of the Penguin Random House posts contained this hashtag. #BookTok is majorly composed of Gen Z girls. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01925121241280069" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 Across many cohorts</a>, women have been the most concerned by social issues. Additionally, Gen Z is consistently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/05/PS_2021.05.26_climate-and-generations_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
characterized</a> as a progressive cohort that is conscious and informed about pressing political matters. Hence, when trying to reach an audience that would be concerned by the escalation of anti-right-of-reading actions, it would make sense to try to reach communities and subcommunities overrepresented by Gen Z girls.</p>
		<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <li>Penguin Random House should have uploaded a video or carousel with images and text in which a renowned author gave a brief message by telling a short history (like <i>Invisible Child</i> author Andrea Elliott), accompanied by a CTA such as "share your story in the comments" or "share with us and others subtle ways in which we can fight against censorship."</li>
            <li>Another option would have been taking the opportunity to promote a new book (whether fiction or non-fiction) that addresses issues related to discrimination, human rights, censorship, or authoritarianism, something that HarperCollins <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@harpercollins/video/7566322297309564190?lang=es-419" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 did</a> by promoting Maria Ressa's book, <i>How to Stand Up to a Dictator</i>. A carousel creatively presenting the themes and background of the book by using metaphors, storytelling, or provocative thought experiments has been ideal due to the higher reach of carousels.</li>
            <li>PRH should have included a #BookTok hashtag to increase its reach among this influential subcommunity.</li>
