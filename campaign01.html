								<p>The renowned publishing house, Penguin Random House, faced a fall in profit of 12% during the first half of 2025.</p>
								<p><h2>What is the new challenge?</h2></p>
								<p>While Penguin Random House still maintains its status as one of the Big Five publishing houses, after the pandemic its position in the market has suffered from periods of important declines in profit and growth. Most recently, during the first half of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;"> Publishers Weekly</a>, PHR profit dropped 12%. The article explained that macroeconomic factors like rising production costs, the political uncertainty, and the restrictive tariff imposed by the Trump administration played a significant role in this fall. The parent company Bertelsmann's spokesman explained that despite the revenue rising to €2.3 billion, operating EBITDA fell 12%, to €255 million ($297.5 million), primarily due <i>“to lower revenues and growth-related expenses in the core U.S. business.”</i></p>
								<p>Interestingly, this and <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 other</a> articles by Publishers Weekly emphasized that under the direction of Nihar Malaviya, PHR has been deeply concerned about <i>fighting for the right to read</i> due to all the unprecedented book bans against diversity and non-normative authors in the U.S. Indeed, the book bans across the country has threatened with undermining the career of minority or marginalized authors and harming the awareness of so many topics that composes the everyday life, fantasies and preocupation of marginalized people. This includes books that talk about police's racial biases, trans childhood, queer love, and much more. All of these, naturally, at the same time harms the sales prospect by the houses that published the books involved. </p>
								<p><h2>What did Penguin Random House?</h2></p>
								<p>Since the growth of social media, users now have more avenues for changing things that matter to them as consumers, being able to deeply affect the market with their voice. TikTok has become the most influential social media platform in the literary industry since 2020 thanks to its subcommunity named #BookTok. According to the data summarized by  <a href="https://wordsrated.com/booktok-statistics/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
   Words Rated</a>, titles published in 2018 saw an increase in their sales of 812% from June 2019 to June 2022. Furthermore, it was found that 48% of TikTok users read more books than before the use of BookTok. For its part, <a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BookTok-for-WEBSITE.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Publishers Associated</a> found that around 38 percent of young people as of 2022 turned to BookTok for recommendations ahead of family and friends. Finally, in a  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiktok/2025/04/21/the-power-of-booktok-why-tiktoks-book-community-is-driving-a-new-era-in-publishing/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Forbes</a> article backed up by TikTok Internal Data from 2025, it was listed that "As of 2025, #BookTok has accumulated 370 billion views, with over 52 million creations jumping on board—skyrocketing bestsellers, reviving backlist titles, and informing reading habits worldwide."</p>
								<p>Now, while the PRH did address these bans in a few TikTok shorts, offering as contest rewards 30 banned books and a carousel with quotes from Percival Everett encouraging the audience to exercise their right to read, it's noteworthy that PRH could have been more proactive with its marketing in certain areas.</p>

											<ul>
                                           <li>The marketing team of Penguin Random House could have created a path toward engagement and conversion by adding a CTA (comment) asking the users to tag a library that required a copy of the 'Unburnable' The Handmaid's Tale edition.</li>
                                           <li>The marketing team of Penguin Random House could have created a path toward greater awareness and engagement by adding a CTA (comment) asking the users to follow up the thread with "unburnable quotes from their favorite books."</li>
                                           <li>The marketing team of Penguin Random House could have created a path toward greater conversion by adding a CTA (comment) telling the users to look for a book copy on their official digital shop.</li>
