								<p>The renowned publishing house, Penguin Random House, faced a fall in profit of 12% during the first half of 2025.</p>
								<p><h2>What is the new challenge?</h2></p>
								<p>While Penguin Random House still maintains its status as one of the Big Five publishing houses, after the pandemic its position in the market has suffered from periods of important declines in profit and growth. Most recently, during the first half of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;"> Publishers Weekly</a>, PHR profit dropped 12%. The article explained that macroeconomic factors like rising production costs, the political uncertainty, and the restrictive tariff imposed by the Trump administration played a significant role in this fall. The parent company Bertelsmann's spokesman explained that despite the revenue rising to €2.3 billion, operating EBITDA fell 12%, to €255 million ($297.5 million), primarily due <i>“to lower revenues and growth-related expenses in the core U.S. business.”</i></p>
								<p>Interestingly, this and <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98500-penguin-random-house-profits-fell-12-in-first-half-of-2025.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 other</a> articles by Publishers Weekly emphasized that under the direction of Nihar Malaviya, PHR has been deeply concerned about <i>fighting for the right to read</i> due to all the unprecedented book bans against diversity and non-normative authors in the U.S. Indeed, the book bans across the country has threatened with undermining the career of minority or marginalized authors and harming the awareness of so many topics that composes the everyday life, fantasies and preocupation of marginalized people. This includes books that talk about police's racial biases, trans childhood, queer love, and much more. All of these, naturally, at the same time harms the sales prospect by the houses that published the books involved. </p>
								<p><h2>What did Penguin Random House?</h2></p>
								<p>Since the growth of social media, users now have more avenues for changing things that matter to them as consumers, being able to deeply affect the market with their voice. TikTok has become the most influential social media platform in the literary industry since 2020 thanks to its subcommunity named #BookTok. According to the data summarized by  <a href="https://wordsrated.com/booktok-statistics/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
   Words Rated</a>, titles published in 2018 saw an increase in their sales of 812% from June 2019 to June 2022. Furthermore, it was found that 48% of TikTok users read more books than before the use of BookTok. For its part, <a href="https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BookTok-for-WEBSITE.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Publishers Associated</a> found that around 38 percent of young people as of 2022 turned to BookTok for recommendations ahead of family and friends. Finally, in a  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiktok/2025/04/21/the-power-of-booktok-why-tiktoks-book-community-is-driving-a-new-era-in-publishing/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
  Forbes</a> article backed up by TikTok Internal Data from 2025, it was listed that "As of 2025, #BookTok has accumulated 370 billion views, with over 52 million creations jumping on board—skyrocketing bestsellers, reviving backlist titles, and informing reading habits worldwide."</p>
								<p>Now, while the PRH did address these bans in a few TikTok shorts, offering as contest rewards 30 banned books and a carousel with quotes from Percival Everett encouraging the audience to exercise their right to read, it's noteworthy that PRH could have been more proactive with its marketing in certain areas.</p>

        <p>On October 6, 2025, a user named reynaaaa.ts uploaded a camera recording of the promotional video for Margaret Atwood's <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> 'Unburnable' edition. While the original stunt was released in 2022, this UGC reached over 90K likes, proving sustained interest.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This post represented a high level of engagement; however, there wasn't any clear path toward conversion harnessed by PRH.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <li><strong>Community Activation:</strong> Add a CTA asking users to tag a library in need of the edition.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Threading:</strong> Encourage users to share "unburnable quotes" from their favorite banned books.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Conversion:</strong> Direct users to the official digital shop to purchase contemporary banned titles.</li>

        <p>On October 5, 2025, Penguin Random House <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@penguinrandomhouse/photo/7557779400587070750?lang=es-419" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 uploaded</a> to TikTok a reel with quotes by different personalities from the publishing house and renowned authors that addressed the topic of book bans as a tribute for Banned Books Week. The reel included quotes by Percival Everett, Ibram X. Kendi, and Nikole Hannah-Jones, among others. This post gathered over 14K views, 1569 likes, and around 41 shares. </p>
        <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This post, aside from not achieving much engagement for a page with over 100K followers (likes corresponded to around 0.01% of the total follower count), didn't include any clear CTA or conversion path.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@penguinrandomhouse/video/7558118852878503199?lang=es-419" target="_blank" style="color: #1d9bf0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
 Another</a> post for the Banned Books Week was uploaded on October 6. In this post, PRH focused on promoting a contest in which the winner would be awarded 30 banned books. This post gathered a bit over 2300 views, 182 likes, and 15 comments.</p>
		<p><strong>Observation:</strong> While the post included a strong CTA consisting of tagging 2 friends and following a few rules indicated in a link added to the description. The post aimed to increase engagement; however, the outcome wasn't as positive, considering that only 15 comments were gathered. </p>
